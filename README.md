## üìã Project Overview

Cafe Menu is a Django-based web application designed for a modern cafe experience. It allows customers to browse a digital menu by category, call a waiter from specific tables, and provides an admin dashboard to monitor waiter call notifications in real-time. The application is styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and visually appealing interface, with full support for Persian language (RTL) and a SQLite database for simplicity.

### ‚ú® Features
- **Digital Menu**: Browse items by category with details like name, description, price, availability, and images.
- **Waiter Call System**: Customers can select a table and call a waiter, with a 1-minute cooldown per table to prevent spam.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time notifications for waiter calls, sorted with oldest at the top.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures a modern, mobile-friendly UI with a cafe-themed aesthetic (brown/orange gradient).
- **Persian Support**: Fully RTL interface with Vazirmatn font for Persian text.
